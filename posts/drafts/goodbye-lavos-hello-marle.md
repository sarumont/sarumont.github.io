I can open the lid with one finger until the "stand" starts to lift the laptop; at that point, the
base begins to slide.

UEFI + RAID fucked me. Ended up GPT + UEFI + my own LVM. God knows if I can ever get Windows back on
this bitch... Really do need 512 UEFI partition.

14.04 fucked me. Needed to allow install-time updates.

Need to have crypttab when mkinitramfs runs. Did not happen in my beta 14.04 installer, so I had to
chroot and manually do it.
