The signal-to-noise ratio of the Internet at large is far too low already, so I do not plan on wasting my time and yours with useless regurgitation.  The topics I plan to discuss (in order of frequency/importance to me/knowledge) are:  

*   programming (general and project-based)
*   software/technology in general
*   baking (breads, mainly)
*   cooking
*   aquaponics (indoor, small-scale)
  
This list is not exhaustive by any means.  My overarching goal here is to give something useful to the world while growing personally and professionally (and having more to give back as a result...).  One very important thing I've learned while writing software is the requirements always change as you get to know your problem space.  I know very little about blogging, so I am certain my habits will adapt as I get into this.  Thanks for visiting.
