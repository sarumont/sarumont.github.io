Ah, yes...another blog post about task management, TODOs, and productivity. As if the world needs one more of these. I have tried many systems over the years (oddly enough, never a strict GTD, it would seem) and found shortcomings in them all. Let's start with an overview of all of these...

# History

## Rands in Repose

Way back in the early days of my software development career (which started in 2006), I was a loyal follower of Michael Lopp aka [rands](1). This was in the halcyon days of Google Reader (RIP), where I kept a curated list of sources and read everything, maintaining Inbox Zero before Inbox Zero was a thing.

Rands posted two articles which I absorbed as my first task management system (where system here means anything I spent more than five minutes considering): [The Taste of the Day](2) and [The Trickle List](3). These two go hand-in-hand, and I used this method or a variation, on and off, across many years. In fact, you can find the remnants of a digital version of this system in [my current dotfiles](4); the earliest note I still have in my Dropbox is 27 December 2013.

Both articles are worth a read; I just re-read them as I am drafting this post. Some key takeaways:

- Priority is relative. To anyone who has ever worked at a startup, this is second nature. 
- Capture everything.
- But ruthlessly discard.

Let's delve into those last two points a bit. They are yin and yang, symbiotic forces which create a beautiful balance...so long as neither is ignored. Neglect your Zen garden at your peril, for [the second law of thermodynamics](5) has no mercy.

At this point in time, it is [well-known](6) that writing things down allows your brain to move on, to not waste energy on the thing you just wrote down. Seriously...just do a quick search for "benefits of writing things down" and get lost in the deluge of Top-X lists. This is THE reason to write everything down: it allows your brain to continue working on what you were working on before that idea or thought popped into your head. Remember, [multitasking is a myth](7); you cannot do multiple things at once, so getting what is now a distraction out of the way as quickly as possible is key to keeping on task.

A quick sidebar: there is research on writing vs. typing which marks writing (with a physical pen and paper) as more beneficial. These studies, however, are focused on note taking and retention. The short story is that you are slower and forced to be more considered in your note-taking rather than capturing notes as close to verbatim as possible, not allowing your brain to process things. I'll always defer toward paper for note-taking for this reason, but I don't believe that "capture" benefits from anything other than speed (there are other digital vs. analog considerations, but I'll tackle those en masse later).

Now to the other side of the Force: deleting things. If you capture everything and never throw everything away, you will wind up with an infinitely growing list of shit to get done, full stop. Your brain can come up with ideas and things to do much faster than your body can complete them, so do not even try to keep up. This is the brilliance of the Evening Scrub. Ruthless. Deletion. Get rid of as much of the chaff as possible, so that only the wheat remains. And as time makes fools of us all, some of that wheat from yesterday, last month, or last week has now gone rancid - throw it out, too.

Ruthlessly discarding tasks calls to mind two anecdotes, both from Tim Ferriss, oddly enough. The simple one is a quote from Tim during some podcast I cannot identify at this moment. The quote, however, is powerful enough to persist in my brain: "The good shit sticks.". Appropriate that this should stick in my head, eh? The context was discussing information overload, and Tim related that he has come to the realization that the good shit sticks, so he does not feel the compulsion to retain everything. I believe this applies to ideas, thoughts, and tasks as well.

The second is anecdote is basically the beginning of [The 4-Hour Workweek](8), namely the section on Tim's Fear Setting exercise. What is the worst that would happen if I didn't do this task? If it is actually important (or becomes so), see my previous point - it will stick (or resurface of its own accord). If not? Who cares if no one does it? Remove it from your list and your mind and let no guilt come from it.

## Kanban

Anyone in the software world has heard of the Kanban method; it has even seeped out into the world at large, to some extent. It did not, however, originate in software - it originated at Toyota as a method for managing manufacturing. This should clue you into the flexibility of the system.

At its core, Kanban consists of three categories of thing: TODOs, Works in Progress (WIPs), and Done items. This is simple enough that it can be applied anywhere. A friend of mine had a family Kanban board for tasks related to moving when his family was making a large move to another state.

The method lends itself to technology, and there are many technological solutions which have come into the world based on Kanban. But it can be as simple as Post-It notes on a whiteboard, wall, or posterboard. All you need is three clear columns.

The beauty of Kanban is its simplicity. But therein also lies the problem. What happens to a task which you cannot complete until someone else provides you something? Is the task Done, to be replaced by a follow-up task once you are unblocked? Or does it go back to TODO? Or do you begin to add complexity by using labels or adding a new category for _Blocked_ items? What happens when your TODO list becomes overwhelming? Do you add a _Backlog_ to keep your immediate vision clear?

Maybe it's just me, but task management always seems to grow in scope. I delved into and out of Kanban, mostly using tools such as [Trello](https://trello.com) and [Todoist](https://todoist.com).

## Bullet Journal

I learned about the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com) method and gave it a shot. It resonated with me for a few reasons:

- it combines many types of thing into one medium (more on this later)
- it is simple yet flexible
- it is analog

As with everything, however, there are some nits to pick. The biggest ones I have with the method as laid out on the main site are:

- the calendaring portion tends to be more burdensome than useful to me
- there is no repository for tasks: everything is supposed to be added to the calendar. This may seem to be a good thing on the surface, but priority is relative (see the Rands method above), and sticking some random task on the calendar for July may be the right decision today but not next week.
- there is no clear "this is what I'm working on today / this week"

Now this last point can be modified by adding a weekly spread or a daily spread... and if you start searching the Internet for these terms, you will no doubt become overwhelmed with the time people have on their hands. This perversion of the Bullet Journal that has happened, mainly on Instagram, it seems, is an example of gross overengineering.

I actually adopted a weekly spread idea this year as I started my fresh BuJo. My idea was simple: I need to have an outlook of what is going on this week (high-level - I still don't think the paper calendar is useful) and what tasks need to get done this week. I also added a habit tracker into the mix. But the burden of re-creating this spread every week became too much for me to want to deal with and it was abandoned at the end of September. I'm honestly surprised it made it that long, however that is probably due to me simplifying my habit tracker from a multi-colored graph to a grid of checkmarks and numbers (i.e. 30 minutes meditating, only 100 burpees, yes I followed my AM routine today).

## Strikethru

I randomly found [Strikethru](https://medium.com/@ChrisKyle/are-you-wasting-time-on-a-bullet-journal-a93b46c8e929), probably searching for some Bullet Journal tips and attempting to simplify my BuJo. It fixes some of the issues I have with BuJo and seems pretty well-rounded. Comments point out that it is basically GTD. I haven't fully adopted Strikethru, however, so I don't have any long-term comments

## The Medium Method(-ish)

Backing up a bit, this method I used sometime after I discovered Bullet Journal originally. I was between paper and Todoist at the time, and there was a great [blog post](9) describing what seemed like a perfect melding of these two worlds. I modified the method, of course, so it goes something like this:

- paper notebook for capturing notes, quotes, etc.
- Todoist for tasks
- Evernote for notes and quotes (my [Commonplace Book](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commonplace_book))
- a Post-it for my daily tasks

There is a daily scrub at the end of the day where anything which was captured that day is added to Todoist. Anything that was done is marked as completed. The next day's TODOs (max 3) are added to a fresh Post-It note and stuck into my notebook. If I have leftover TODOs from the day, that Post-It stays; otherwise, it hits the recycle bin.

In Todoist, I managed things via projects and labels. I used time-related labels (`@5m`, `@15m`, etc.) to indicate short tasks I could squeeze into some time between meetings where I couldn't get any useful coding done. I also used `@soon` and `@blocked` labels as well as a `@today`, which reflects the Post-It note.

## Getting Things Done (GTD)

As I mentioned above, I have never consciously applied GTD. In writing this article, I have spent some time researching GTD, however, and it seems like the perfectly simple and adaptable system to start with. And indeed various iterations of my own systems have basically been GTD or GTD-like.

# System Goals

Now that we have gone through my history (and, I think, a fairly decent overview of some of the main systems out there), let's back up a step and think about the goals of a good productivity system.

## Capture

The first consideration is capture. How can you expect to do anything if you don't capture what it is you are wanting to do? Now the brain is great, but it helps our brains offload and focus to get things OUT of it. I don't want to remember what I have to do when it will make me less productive when doing said things.

Now for me, there are multiple things which could be captured in a day at the desk:

- more tasks
- notes (design notes, meeting notes, etc.)
- quotes

You may have more or less items in that list, but you will at the very least have the first item in that list.

## Categorization

Everyone probably has two main categories of stuff they need to do:

- work
- personal

Work can be further subdivided into different projects. Personal could be "Self", "Family", and any number of groups one is a member of. This can get tricky as well as many, especially in software, have external task management systems forced upon them for work.

## Work Management (aka getting shit done)

This is where the rubber hits the road: what am I working on now? What am I working on next? What needs to get done by X date?

# Tools

It is worth discussing tools somewhat, though that can be a whole can of worms in and of itself. Indeed, many who would become productive find themselves mired in productivity tools, getting nothing done but playing with these tools.

There is one main line of delineation here: analog vs. digital. Do you use pen and paper? Phone and laptop? Both? There are pros and cons to either side of this debate, and I generally lean towards the idea that one should use the best tool for the job at hand (and acquire it if one does not have it!).

## Pen and Paper

It is simple, proven, ubiquitous, doesn't lag, and doesn't crash. But it can burn, fade, be eaten by a dog (or a kid), or drown in the coffee you spilled on your desk. I think paper's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses for the capture portion of 


My wife often asks whether I had a good and productive work day; I constantly remind her that these are separate things
