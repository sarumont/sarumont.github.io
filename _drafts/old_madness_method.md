OK - I have 3 paper books in my arsenal and 2 major electronic tools. Book #1 is the Rhodia Webnotebook (dot grid - fucking awesome). A5 size (5.8" x 8.3"). This is the daily. I add the date every day and it stays beside me. I will add tasks, quotes, or notes under the day. This is the bullet journal-ish part. Tasks have a bullet, quotes have an open circle, notes have a hyphen.
If I do "whiteboarding", I'll flip to the next clean page.
I also leave a page for index at the beginning of the journal.
(though the index is still WIP-ish).
At the end of the day, I employ the 2 digital tools: tasks go into Todoist, Quotes and Notes go into Evernote. I have a notebook called "Commonplace Book" with notes by category (i.e. Inspiration, Entreprenuership, Minimalism, etc.). This is where I add the quotes.
I'll save the notes under a pertinent section (i.e. - Project-based notes).
I'll also take pictures of any whiteboard-esque drawings to add to said project notebooks.
Then, I'll clear tasks out of Todoist which I accomplished that day.
And I'll put my top 3 goals for the next day on a Post-It and stick that in the notebook for the next day.
I mark things in my notebook, so I know I have migrated them. Migrated tasks get an arrow, completed tasks get a checkmark, "deleted" tasks get an X.
If I finished my tasks for the day, the old Post-It goes away. If not, I carry it forward. A 2-Post-It day sucks.
I don't do the monthly / weekly calendar shit that Bullet Journal specifies. I tried it and didn't feel like it provided value.
The thing I am currently working on tweaking is how to track media consumption notes (i.e. read this, watch that) and how to track my reading list. I currently have those scattered across Todoist, Amazon wish lists, and Goodreads (book reading list).
The result is Todoist is my master task list. Paper is good for mental retention (and purging), but I keep it as a temporary medium.
I use projects in Todoist to categorize and labels to denote what I'm working on (instead of due dates). I reserve due dates for "hard deadlines".
So I have @soon for things I want to accomplish soon - used when finding next tasks.
And some others like @5m @15m @1h for denoting time (I have 20 minutes until this next meeting - what bullshit can I knock out?)
And lastly, @today. Which matches my sticky note. â˜º
The other two paper things are a pocket notebook (+ pen) for taking notes on the go (Google Now -> Note To Self also works).
And my real journal, which is just a traditional journal / diary (write long-form, stream-of-conciousness)
And I think that about covers it...
I should blog this... ðŸ˜›
