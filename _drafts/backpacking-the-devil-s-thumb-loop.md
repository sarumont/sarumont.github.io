It has been close to a decade since I last backpacked, so I finally got my ass back in gear. This
past weekend, I decided to ease back into it with a 2-day, 1-night trip to [Devil's Thumb][devil]. I
performed better than I expected after nearly a decade, but the trip was not without issue.

# Day 1

I decided to camp near Devil's Thumb Lake. There wasn't really a "middle" spot to stop, so I saved
the longer distance for my second day, as it was going to be mostly flat and downhill. Kyle dropped
me off about half a mile from the trailhead at around 0845 on Saturday. Once I got to the trail, I
pretty much started gaining elevation immediately.

I reached Jasper Lake at around 1030 and pulled my pack off for the first major stop. I packed the
good camera, and it was safely packed away anyway. I assembled and took a few shots around the lake.

A decent rest and quick snack later, I packed up the camera and continued up. I reached Devil's
Thumb Lake just after noon and plopped down to lunch. Given that I was just at the tree line, it
took me a bit of time to find a suitable pair of trees from which to hang. And this brings us to the
first issue I faced, as made evident from the photos below.

You may notice that my tarp was a bit close to one tree. Like I said - the pickings were slim up
near the tree line. That wasn't a huge deal, but as I pitched my tarp, I realized that my guy lines
and stakes were not in the tarp's stuff sack. This is a result of moving between three different
packs as I was trying to find the right size.

I ended up going back to my very first pack, a Kelty Yukon. I felt like it fit fine around the
house, but after a few miles I realized the straps were bearing down too much on my shoulders. It is
now up on Craigslist to find a new home with a young backpacker.

Luckily, I had my 30' Amsteel utility line to fix one side to a downed tree. I fashioned a stake out
of a stick and used my 10' utility line to tie down the other side. It was a pretty tight fit, but
it could have been worse.

The rain moved in just after I got my shelter pitched, so I reclined for a quick nap while the storm
passed.

Afterward, I wandered around to snap some photos of the high elevation wildflowers in all their
glory.

With only about four hours of sleep the night before, I headed to bed early as another storm rolled
in with some seriously blustery winds.

# Day 2

My original plan was to wake up early, break camp, and hike to the top of the pass to catch the
sunrise. When I awoke at 0500, however, I was too damn tired. I got up about 0800 and made the
intense climb up to the pass.

From this point, the rest of the hike was pretty easy. Hiking the West side of the divide was quite
beautiful and quick, as the High Lonesome Trail was pretty much flat. I could see Winter Park, both
the town and the resort, quite clearly.

I hit the King Lake trail back down below the tree line, stopping off to have lunch near Boulder
Creek and refill my water bottles.

I took the short jaunt over to Bob and Betty Lakes. The beginning of the trail provided quite the
climb, but the views were worth it. I got to see the fresh tracks made by
