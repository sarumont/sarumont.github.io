title: 2019&#58; A Disappointing MTB season
layout: post
---

I just finished approximately 2/3 of the Monarch Mindbender, which was to be my longest MTB race yet at 88 miles. I bailed at 52.3 miles, in the middle of a long but gradual (12 mile) climb up Marshall Pass Rd. First, I ran out of water (started the climb with a full 70 oz.). Next, my legs started going as I was dropped by the duo I had been riding with most of the day. Finally, my headphone batteries died, and I quickly caved. "Why climb, " I mused, "if I won't make the cutoff anyway and will have to bail back down this road?" And so I turned around, signed out of the race, and headed to Elevation Beer Company for a well-deserved brew.

A picture is worth a thousand words (at least), and so I present the reason for my abject failure to compete this MTB season:

![What a graph!]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018vs2019.png)

For those unfamiliar with training, the big thing to observe here is the light blue area chart. This represents my fitness as calculated by my heart rate training stress score (hrTSS). Basically, this metric is an estimate of how "fit" one is, derived from exertion during training. Fitness (CTL) is the only metric that really matters for the point of this post.

I'll point out two things in that graph that I feel are relevant:

 1. My peak CTL this year is 42; I surpassed that in MARCH of 2018
 1. What the hell was I doing from October through April?!?

# Life

Life happens. In the smooth arc from my last tracked ride of 2018 (CTL 62) until my first tracked ride of 2019 (CTL 0), I have had plenty going on: transitioning out of the van, buying a house, moving, home improvement projects, and general family responsibilities. This has left no room for training in the off-season, meaning I started from 0 this year. Everything I did last year? Gone. On top of that, I wasn't even cross-training regularly (as I was before the 2018 season - even while I was building the van out).

Now I don't mean to throw up my hands and blame _life_; I chose all the things which took precedent over training in the off-season with full agency. I also did not have an offseason training plan in place to ensure that I would train, regardless of other circumstances. As pathetic as my 2019 season may seem, metrics-wise, I *have* had consistency in my training, alongside many new life responsibilities.

The takeaway here is this: you *cannot* allow yourself to get ahead of (or even close to) the end of the runway. If you want to be consistently training, your calendar *must* reflect that. And it must do so at least a month in advance at all times. It becomes all too easy to ignore things we don't block time off for, especially when we (as a society) tend to overload ourselves anyway.

# The Universe

As my support system is quick to point out, a 52.3 mile ride (69 w/ the bail back to town) on Monarch Crest is no small feat. As I sit here, disappointed in myself and nursing my sore body, I must acknowledge that even a failure to complete is still a success in many regards. I pushed hard, but I bit off more than I could chew. Unfortunately, the Monarch Mindbender will no longer be run as a race. But I have a GPX file, and I will be back out there to conquer it.

So while I am disappointed, I am not deterred. I have recently spent some time to get *all* my self-quantification data into TrainingPeaks, giving me a single platform from which I can holistically analyze my quantified body. I've also been reading books which I should have read a year (or more) ago on training, planning, etc. In short, I am accumulating tools which I can put to use to plan an effective and efficient training plan going forward.

My goal this off-season will be to maintain my base, ideally keeping a CTL of 30-40 to build off of in spring. I've done a decent job of incorporating cross-training this season (1-2 strength/HIIT days, 1-2 yoga days each week); I want to bump this up during the off-season to build a bit more base strength and core stability (and flexibility). The rough plan I have in my head now is 2-3 strength, 1-3 yoga, and 2-4 rides each week. 

For the remainder of the outdoor season, I'll be riding as much as possible (especially once the leaves begin to change). But I don't plan to focus on anything but enjoying myself while I'm out there. It is important that we not lose the love of the sport that brought us to racing in the first place. I do plan to continue something I started this season (kinda): skills building. I've spent plenty of time at the bike park, becoming comfortable hucking rollers and table tops. I've also tried to start drilling basics (bunny hops, track stands, etc.) at home, and I want to continue down this path. I learned to mountain bike with a bunch of ex-roadies, so I never picked up on the "basic" skills that many mountain bikers seem to have.

# And Everything

I decided to race the Fall Classic this season, as I am now a Summit County resident. This will be a short (21 mile) race for me, and I'm feeling good about it. The course is comprised of trails I ride on a regular basis now, and 21 miles means I can drop the hammer (within reason - blowing up on a 21 mile race would be quite embarrassing). 

Beyond 8 Sept 2019, I have no training scheduled; I have two weeks to remedy that. And I definitely will. In the early season this year, I took many spin classes before the snow melted enough for me to get out on the trail, and I grew to enjoy them in some weird, Nightingale-esque way. I am also considering getting a road or cross bike for outdoor mud season training. A fat bike is, of course, on the wishlist for true winter training. Lastly, I hope to make a pilgrimage or two down to the desert during the winter to keep my technical chops up.

This season, I've taken a lot more onto my plate. I look forward to balancing myself, family, work, and training even better going forward while working my way into being competitive. Endurance sports take time to ramp up, and I'm only in my second year focusing on racing. As with everything, I must continue to evaluate and tweak to improve. Build, measure, grow. And shred.
