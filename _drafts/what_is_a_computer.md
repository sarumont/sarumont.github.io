Last year, I embarked upon a journey that I've mentally flirted with for some time: I replaced my laptop with an iPad Pro (and Magic Keyboard).

Annoyances:

"Blink would like to paste from Discord - would you like to allow this?"


The 11” is a bit cramped, the keyboard is annoying at times (the number row is under the screen, so it’s hard to hit), iPadOS gets in the way a bit. The OS experience is either great or terrible, depending on the task at hand…it rarely gets to “mediocre” 😛

I was already starting to lean that way, honestly. The annoyances/limitations of iPad OS wearing on me over the year and the form factor were probably the biggest factors.

Probably still a fine decision for “normal people”, too. Not a geek who has spent countless hours making his desktop as efficient as possible to perform the task at hand, building `vim`-like keybindings into everything, and using tiling window managers. 🤣

Some weird shit sometimes with the on-screen keyboard chip blocking inputs it is not on top of. This occurs while using the Magic Keyboard.

Why is the Magic Keyboard's USB-C port only for power and not a TB port? :facepalm:
