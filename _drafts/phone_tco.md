title: iPhone vs. Android TCO

My Google Pixel 3 is now, officially, unsupported. Google will release one more "bolus" update for it to patch up some of the more egregious Android 12 bugs, as this was the last official release the phone received (and is still a bit raw). This has me thinking about security, updates, and total cost of ownership (TCO).

As I have aged, I find myself less concerned with tweaking and customization of my tech and more concerned with things just working (the exception being my development environment, but that is more of a case of me refining my toolkit than anything else). As such, I have used my Pixel 3 for three years. This is the first phone I have ever used until it became unsupported by the vendor, though my Nexus 6p came close before it developed hardware issues, meriting a replacement Pixel XL from Google (which lasted two years until the Pixel 3 promotion which yielded a free Pixel 3 upgrade).

Google (and now Samsung) promises three years of OS updates for all its devices. With the Pixel 6, it has added on an additional two years of security updates. So assuming the hardware holds up (which, with Google, has always been a problem), you can expect five supported years out of a brand new Pixel 6 (Pro).

Apple, on the other hand, does not officially promise any software support duration that I can see, though their MO is to sell and support the hardware for three years. But their software track record speaks for itself. The oldest supported iPhone, according to [this excellent matrix](https://dorianroy.com/blog/category/ios-support-matrix/), is the iPhone 6s, which was launched in 2015. If we extrapolate, that gives it at least seven years of software support (it can run iOS 15, which is out now and will not be replaced until iOS 16 in 2022).

So, let's start there - three and five years for a Pixel, seven years for an iPhone. I feel we need to include the three year breaking point due to the fact that the iPhone is not only getting security updates but also new functionality along that seven year timespan (granted, the iPhone 6s will not have feature parity with the iPhone 13, but it will have some subset of the functionality baked into iOS 15).

| Phone                                   | MSRP  | $$$/year |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Google Pixel 6 Pro 128GB (3 years)      | $899  | $299.66  |
| Google Pixel 6 Pro 128GB (5 years)      | $899  | $179.80  |
| Apple iPhone 13 Pro 128GB (7 years)     | $999  | $142.71  |
| Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB (7 years) | $1099 | $157     |

Best case for the Pixel is a $22.80/year premium over the Pro Max. But how do the "budget" handsets hold up?

| ----------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Google Pixel 6 128GB (3 years)      | $599  | $199.66  |
| Google Pixel 6 128GB (5 years)      | $599  | $119.80  |
| Apple iPhone 13 128GB (7 years)     | $799  | $114.14  |

The Pixel 6 comes in closer to the iPhone 13 at only $5 more per year. This is definitely the sweet spot for the Pixel lineup, as pretty much every reviewer on the Internet has pointed out.

# Conclusions

I realize there are many more manufacturers of Android phones than just Google; this is the blessing and curse of the Android world. But Google also offers the best software support now with its 3yr/5yr policy. The previous best (and current best, outside of the Pixels) is 3 years. So if you take the cheapest iPhone in this comparison, you will need an Android phone to cost $342.42 (`$114.14 x 3`) to be competitive on a purely financial basis.

This is an intentionally limited point of view; there are MANY more factors to consider when choosing a smartphone. I didn't even get into resale value (iPhones win here, of course, but I did not analyze that gap), which is another potential financial consideration. Though if your intention is to buy a phone and use it until it no longer receives updates, resale value is not a huge factor.

My point here was to shine a light on a narrow but often skipped-over point. The stereotype of the iPhone is that it is expensive, but I feel I have debunked that, at least if the intention is to squeeze every last bit of (apple) juice out of it. If you are buying a new phone every year or two, then this comparison does you little good. But for those of us who value consistency, reliability, waste reduction, and frugality, this is a useful point to add to your smartphone comparison matrix (what, you don't have one?).
