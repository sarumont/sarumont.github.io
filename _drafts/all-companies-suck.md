title: All Companies Suck

When faced with the sack, one of my co-workers recently asked me how I do it. How do I stay energized? How do I continue to contribute to the company in light of layoffs, lack of direction, and uninspiring leadership? My response was the title of this post:

> All companies suck

Surely this is an overly cynical point of view, you may be thinking. "I love my company; it doesn't suck! I know plenty of people who love their companies, too." 

I maintain my assertion, but perhaps it would help to frame it in the style of the paraphrased Tolstoy quote:

> Each company sucks in its own way

Now, you may be thinking, your statement is simply an overly-dramatic, clickbait-y way of saying that all companies are different. And you may be right. But...is there not a benefit to framing the statement in the negative?
