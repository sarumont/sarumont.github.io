My relationship with social media is a mixed bag of thoughts and emotions ranging from curiosity to
loathing; hope to hate. I did not even voluntarily create my first social media account (Facebook);
it was created for me by my then-girlfriend. Each platform since then has provided me
with a different perspective (or found me with one).

# My Social Media History

I'll indulge in a brief autobiography of my social media usage over the years. This is largely to
provide a frame of reference for the thoughts I wish to convey later in this post

## Facebook

When I was joined to Facebook, it was still limited to college students. I had to use my
[SPSU](http://www.spsu.edu/) email address to verify I was, in fact, enrolled in college. My
relationship with Facebook has largely stayed the same over the years: I keep it at a distance and
derive little value from it, mainly from being able to get in touch with friends and relatives whose
current contact info I otherwise do not have. Keeping up with what is happening in a certain
person's life is also a minor boon, though this 'feature' fully depends on the other person's use of
the platform.

## Twitter

I believe I signed up for Twitter due to a friend of mine introducing me to the fledgling startup (this 
was circa 2008). I struggled to see the point of posting 140-character messages for all the world to
see; now, I realize the point is [to issue executive orders, fire members of cabinet, and generally
make a fool of oneself](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump).

My Twitter heyday actually came after moving to Wichita, KS in 2008. For some reason, this town was
an extremely beneficial microcosm of the Twittersphere. I found a very active community, which
regularly met in meatspace at so-called Tweet-ups, through which I met many great people, including 
some of my dearest friends to this day. 

I cannot say WHY this community flourished so, but I can guess it was a combination of timing
(relatively new technology) and the size of Wichita (relatively small city).
I also do not know if the Wichita
Twittersphere is still as it once was, but I can only guess it has changed, as all things do. Either
way, my experience with Twitter after moving to Denver in 2011 was absolutely nothing like it. I
tried to extract value from it, but the local community was not valuable nor was the Twittersphere
at large. 

And so Twitter gradually fell by the wayside, all but forgotten until I deleted my account just recently.

## Google Buzz / Wave / Plus / Fail

Google will never build a competitive social network in the image of Facebook, and it seems they may 
realize this by now. They cannot hope to steal wind from Facebook's sails; they have tried and failed 
so much. Being a tech person, however, I have dabbled in Google's social network attempts over the 
years. The technology has been fantastic, and the platforms have, arguably, been the best thing 
going from a technical standpoint, but they entered the game too late. Social networks gain value 
exponentially based on active users, and Google's attempts just didn't catch on.

I was a regular user of Google Plus for quite some time for two main purposes: 
 - news aggregation
 - [Ingress](https://www.ingress.com/)

Once I stopped playing Ingress, my Plus usage dropped to nothing, leaving this account to collect
virtual cobwebs.

## Instagram

I can't quite recall why I signed up for Instagram, but it was relatively late in the game. It had
long been acquired by Facebook and was far from nascent. I knew about it for quite some time before
signing up, but it had never appealed to me. Currently, this is my most active presence on social
media, though that has been changing lately, as this post is about to discuss.

## Others

I never got into the Foursquare craze, though I did sign up at some point to take advantage of
money-saving deals. I am also fairly active on Untappd with my beer-enjoying friends and Strava with
my cycling and running friends. These are minor splashes in the grand scheme of the world of social
media at large, however. I also signed up for Snapchat under duress but deleted my account within a
day; I see no appeal in that platform.

# Thoughts on Social Media

And now, to the real reason I'm writing this post; I have been ruminating on social media quite a
bit lately due to a combination of plenty of drive time in the van, a natural reduction in Instagram
use, meeting someone my age with NO social media presence whatsoever, and a decent amount of time
spent listening to my favorite podcast, [Note to
Self](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/notetoself).













During this past election cycle, however, I would say
the balance tipped slightly toward the negative, as I saw much debate and hatred when I occasioned
myself to log in.
