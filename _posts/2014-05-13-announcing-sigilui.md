title: Announcing SigilUI
layout: post
---

Working on a project last week, I ran into some gaps in the Android SDK. Namely, the ability to set
a custom font in the layout XML; I feel this is a pretty huge oversight by the Android developers.
Rather than just hack around it, I have created [sigilui][1].

I have no grand plans for the library, so it will just grow organically for the time being.

Version 0.1.0 will be uploaded to Maven central once I can get the project into Sonatype. In the
meantime, feel free to check it out [on github][1]
