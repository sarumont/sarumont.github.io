## about

I am a developer with a passion for building things and solving problems. I am currently employed as
an architect at [Devsupply][1], building next-gen tools for developers.

No longer living in a van, I am a father of three and dedicated husband, living in beautiful Summit County, Colorado. 
Though I wouldn't discount a future van build that can accommodate 5...

I am passionate about the outdoors, and I can usually be found on a trail somewhere. Or not found,
depending on the trail. Based on the weather and location, I'll be equipped with my mountain bike (Colonel Larry
Mustard, the Bananajammer), skis, or just some hiking boots. I am a mountain bike racer and Spin instructor at 
[Psycle 9600][https://www.psycle9600.com] here in Breckenridge, CO.

I'm also a [BJCP Certified][2] beer judge, homebrewer on sabbatical, and compulsive DIYer.
