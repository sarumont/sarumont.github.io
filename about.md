## about

I am a developer with a passion for building things and solving problems. I am currently working on
the [nuvos SDK][1], a true one-and-done Java solution for writing enterprise-class applications.

When I'm not hacking away on nuvos, I'm probably brewing beer, shredding some fresh powder, or
hiking in the beautiful Rocky Mountains in Colorado. I may not be a native, but I got here as
quickly as I could.
